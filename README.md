# genetic-backpack
School project

It's quite simple:
Pack a backpack. It's not allowed to weight more than 5kg. All items have a specific value, and must only be used once. What's the highest achievable value? Must be solved using a genetic algorithm.

This project is quite rushed. I cared about proper OOP in the start, but later just started throwing Math.random in here and there
